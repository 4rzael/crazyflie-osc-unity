# crazyflie-osc-unity

A Unity client for my crazyflie-osc server.

## How to run it ?

An example scene is present.

* Open it with Unity.

* Select the object OscManager and set your Osc server address / port within the "drones" server.

* Select the object LpsManager and set your LPS nodes positions

* Select the object DronesManager and set your drones radio URIs.

* Run the game (in editor mode)

* When the console prints "SYSTEM OK", the system is ready

* Without quitting the game, go in scene view, then move the drone (Drone_0) where you want it to be.

* Click on the button "OSC - Start sync - Send" in the drone inspector

* Move your drone in the unity editor

* Enjoy
